# She can't run

When her dilated eyes can’t help but 
linger back to 
them “glory days”,

she should throw in the towel,
drenched in the fact, 
that she can’t be on those street corners anymore.

She can pull the trigger of that empty gun,
telling you she does it “all for fun”.
But why hide from the past if she can’t run?
