# Russian roulette

Go ahead, 
pull the trigger,
why put up a fight?

When you can be another 
“you deserve better”
by the end of the night.

Tell me pretty white lies
like, "I swear, 
I feel the heat."

Tell me pretty white lies
like, "I never tasted 
nothing so sweet."

When the shot 
still rings out 
it's my teeth that I'll bite,

saying, "Go ahead, babe, 
disappoint me,"
because you do it just right.
