# Cookie cutter

She was 
a perfectionist,
who wore perfectionism
as a badge of honor,

cutting 
her errors 
out 
like paper dolls.

Because if it wasn't 
the crème de le crème 
it was automatically 
the bottom of the barrel.

But when 
“perfect” 
doesn’t even exist
and done does:

she puts down those scissors, 
leaving the edges jagged, 
to beam at 
her crooked paper dolls.
