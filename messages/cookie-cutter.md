# Cookie cutter

She was a perfectionist,
who wore perfectionism
as a badge of honor,

to cut
her errors out 
like paper dolls.

If it wasn't the crème de le crème 
it was automatically 
the bottom of the barrel.

But when “perfect” 
doesn’t even exist
and done does:

she puts down the scissors, 
leaving the edges jagged, 
to beam at her crooked paper dolls.
