# The last bite

She can act like it,
like there are no signs
that the steak 
has gone bad.

She can tell herself
how good the steak looked 
when she first saw it 
on the laminated menu.

She can bring the steak 
right back home to sit
on the kitchen counter
in its crappy styrofoam packaging.

She can gawk at 
what advertised itself as
“juiciest steak on the menu”
slowly rot from the inside out.

She can “give it space” 
and “give it time”
and give, give, give 
until there’s nothing left to give.

She can act like it
but I know she knows,
she doesn’t fucking want to 
eat the steak.
