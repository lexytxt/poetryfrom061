# Pin-up

Why
can’t I
be laminated?

Like that
bachelor’s degree
hung up on your wall,

with the
glossy finish
to match.

I know
if I were
laminated,

I’d be as
important to you
as that off-white piece of paper.

I know
if I were
laminated,

I wouldn’t
have to
curl at the edges of your gaze.

So, pretty please,
laminate me
next.
