# Pin-up

Why
can’t I
be laminated?

Like that
bachelor’s degree
pinned up on your wall,

with the
glossy finish
to match.

Maybe,
when I'm
laminated,

I'll be as
important to you 
as that off-white piece of paper.

And I won't
have to curl at 
the edges of your gaze.

So, pretty please,
laminate me
next.
