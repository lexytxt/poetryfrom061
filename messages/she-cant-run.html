    <h2>She can’t run</h2>
    <p>
        She can’t be on those<br>
        street corners anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
        She can say,<br>
        “What’s done is done.”
    </p>
    <p>
        She can pull the trigger<br>
        of that empty gun.
    </p>
    <p>
        She can hide from the past,<br>
        but she can’t run.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the only person left<br>
        to root for her is her.
    </p>
    <p>
        She just can’t be on those<br>
        street corners anymore.
