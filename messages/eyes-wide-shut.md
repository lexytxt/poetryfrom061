# Eyes wide shut

It didn’t start in at the doctor:
with her eyes wide shut,
her pupils blackened,
and her eyebrows raised up.

It started at the  
casino entrance,
where she was 
shit out of luck.

It started on the  
blackjack table,
where she spent
her last buck.

It started in the dingy 
parking lot,
where she dozed off
in his truck.

I just want you to know
it didn’t start at the doctor
when her back slid down
the coldest vinyl couch.
