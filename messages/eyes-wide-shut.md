# Eyes wide shut

I want you to know
It didn’t start at 
that doctor's office:

with her eyes wide shut,
her pupils blackened,
and her eyebrows raised up.

It started at the 
casino entrance,
where she was shit out of luck.

It started on the  
blackjack table,
where she spent her last buck.

It started in the dingy 
parking lot,
where she dozed off in his truck.

But it didn’t start 
at that doctor’s office
when her back hit the coldest vinyl couch.
