# Eyes wide shut

It didn’t start with
her eyes wide shut,
her pupils blackened,
and her eyebrows raised up.

It started at the 
dazzling entrance,
where she was 
shit out of luck.

It started on the  
dirty blackjack table,
where she spent 
her last buck.

It started in the 
dingy parking lot,
where she dozed off 
in his truck.

But it didn’t start 
at that the doctor’s 
when her back hit 
the cold vinyl couch.
