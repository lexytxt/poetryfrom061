    <h2>The last bite</h2>
    <p>
        She can act like it,<br>
        like there are no signs<br>
        that the steak has gone bad.
    </p>
    <p>
        She can tell herself<br>
        how good the steak<br>
        looked on the menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        She can bring the steak back home,<br>
        to sit on her kitchen counter,<br>
        inside its crappy styrofoam packaging.
    </p>
    <p>
        She can watch what advertised itself as<br>
        “the juiciest steak on the menu”<br>
        rot from the inside out.
    </p>
    <p>
        She can “give it space” and “give it time”<br>
        and give, give, give,<br>
        until there’s nothing left to give.
    </p>
    <p>
        She can act like it,<br>
        but deep down, I know she knows,<br>
        she just doesn’t fucking like the steak.
